            <h4>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h4>
            <p>
                 The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external
                services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Application, any information you provide

                Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies
                and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your
                discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices

                taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no
                security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception
                or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

            <h4>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h4>
            <p>
                 We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data

            </p>
            <h4>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
            <p>
                 Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to
                signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
                technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
                to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
                standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
                version of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h4>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

                for contacting the third party directly.
